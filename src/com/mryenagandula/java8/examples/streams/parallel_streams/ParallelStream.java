* Java 8 - Parallel Streams (DATA PROCESSING AND PERFORMANCE)
* - Parallel Streams are introduced in java 8. It meant for utilizing
*   multiple cores of the processor
*
* - Normally any java code as one stream of processing, where it is executed
*   sequentially Whereas by using parallel streams, we can divide the code
*   into multiple streams that are executed in parallel on separate cores
*   and the final result is combination of individual outcomes.
*
* - The order of execution, is not under our control.
